// Simple example of a request file
// I’ve added time numbers in the comments just to make it more readable. Person names
// can be any string. In this example they are p1, p2, and so on for convenience.
T 		 // time=0
R p1 4 5 // This means person p1 arrived at floor 2 and wants to go to floor 5.
R p2 3 4
R p3 1 4 // Note that three people arrived at the first time click.
T 		 // time=1
R p4 3 5
T 		 // time=2
T 		 // time=3
T 		 // time=4
T 		 // time=5 No requests showed up at time clicks 2, 3, 4, or 5.
T 		 // time=6
R p5 2 1
R p6 5 1
R p7 1 2
